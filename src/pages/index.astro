        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jan Sháněl and I come from the Czech Republic. I am
          a self taught web developer who likes to create highly interactive web
          applications. I like to study new possibilities that development tools
          and libraries offer for delivering the best possible result to the
          user.
        </p>
        <p>
          My original field of study was geoinformatics and cartography. I
          believe it brought me the ability to think critically about
          application designs and requirements. In addition, I maintain an
          active awareness of maps and their libraries on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy riding my road bike or running through the
          woods with a map. As a more passive recreation, I won't turn down a
          good series or a computer game once in a while.
        </p>
